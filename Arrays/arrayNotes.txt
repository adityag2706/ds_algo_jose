Low level arrays


Memory of a computer stored in bits
Typical unit is byte, which is 8 bits
Computers typically use a memory address
Each byte associated with unique address

Computer's main memory performs as random access memory RAM
Just as easy to retrieve byte #867929 as it is to retrieve byte #309
Individual byte of memory can be stored or retrieved in O(1) time.

Array --> group of related variables stored one after the other in a contiguous
portion of the computer's memory
Test string --> stored as an ordered sequence of individual character,s
In Python Unicode character --> 16 bits (2 bytes)

Any cell of an array can be accessed in constant time --> O(1)


Referrential Arrays -- (arrays that use object references)
Each element is a reference to the object
This howq python generally creates lists.
It allows python to make sure all the elements in the list are of the same size(bytes)
which allows it to find the exact position based on the index given.



Dynamic Arrays

--> In dynamic arrays you don't need to specify how big an array is beforehand.

--> in python lists often have more capacity than the current length
If elements keep getting appended this extra space runs out.
