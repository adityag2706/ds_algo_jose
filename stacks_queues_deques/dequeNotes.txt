A deque also known as a double ended queue is an ordered collection of items similar
to the queue.
It has two ends, a front and a rear and the items remain positioned in the collection.
What makes a deque different is the unrestrictive nature of adding and removing items 
New items can be added at the front or the rear.
Similarly existing items can be removed from the either end.
