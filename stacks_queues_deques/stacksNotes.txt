Overview:
A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of items where
the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place
at the same end. The end is commonly referred to as top; the end opposite of top
is known as base
Stacks are LIFO - last in first out!!
Provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection.
Newer items are near the top while older items are near the base.

Push -- add/ append an element to the top(end) of the collection
Pop - remove an element from the top(end) of the collection
So last added element always gets removed first.

you can reverse an entire stack by popping out the elements and adding them
to a new stack one by one.
