Overview:
A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of items happen at one end
called the "rear" and the removal of existing items happens at the other end; commonly
called the front.

As an element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way towards the front,
waiting until that time when it is the next element to be removed.
Queues are FIFO - first in first out. The oldest element is removed first.
Terms :
Enqueue -> add an element to the queue at the rear.
Dequeue -> remove element from the queue from the front
